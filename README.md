# Carleton University Theme for Drupal 7

Based on the excellent [Adaptive Theme](https://drupal.org/project/adaptivetheme).

## Requirements

* [Adaptive Theme](https://drupal.org/project/adaptivetheme) version 7.x-3.x (built on 3.2)

## Admin Menu

Compatable, ensure the "Adjust..." and "Keep Menu..." options are disabled in admin/config/administration/admin_menu

## Responsive Menu Setup

1. The default Main Menu block must be placed in the Leaderboard region.
2. In order for a second level menu to be visible, it must be enabled. To do this you need to edit a top level menu item in the Main Menu and enable "Show as expanded".
